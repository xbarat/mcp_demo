# MCP Learning Path: From Zero to Mastery

## Overview
This learning path is designed to help you master the Model Context Protocol (MCP) through hands-on practice and progressive complexity. Each milestone builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation in MCP capabilities.

## 🎯 Milestone 1: Basic Server & Tools
**Goal**: Create and run basic MCP servers with simple tools and resources
- [X] **1.1 Setup development environment (5 MINS)**
  - [X] Install MCP using `uv add "mcp[cli]"` or `pip install mcp`
  - [X] Create a new project directory
  - [X] Test MCP installation with `mcp version`

    *detailed how-to found in docs/01_set_up.md*

- [X] **1.2. Create Basic Echo Server**
  - [X] Implement basic server with FastMCP
  - [X] Add simple tool (add function)
  - [X] Test with `mcp dev server.py`
  - [X] Verify tool execution through MCP Inspector

  *start with the inspector for convenience. notes in doc/02_basic_echo.md*

- [X] **1.3 Resource Implementation**
  - [X] Create static resource endpoint (config://app)
  - [X] Create dynamic resource with parameters (calculator://{operation}/{a}/{b})
  - [X] Test resource access patterns (product://{product_id} with error handling)
  - [X] Document resource response times through logging

  *implemented various resources including static, dynamic, and error handling examples. notes in doc/03_resource_implementation.md*
