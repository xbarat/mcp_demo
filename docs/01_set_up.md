Here's a summary of the steps we've followed to install and set up MCP and UV:

### 1. Install UV Package Manager
```bash
# Install UV using Homebrew
brew install uv
```

### 2. Project Setup
```bash
# Create and navigate to project directory
mkdir test-mcp
cd test-mcp

# Initialize project with UV
uv init test-mcp
```

### 3. Add Dependencies
```bash
# Add ruff for linting
uv add ruff

# Add MCP with CLI support
uv add "mcp[cli]"
```

### 4. Environment Management
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 5. Verify Installation
```bash
# Check installed packages
uv sync

# Run ruff to verify linting works
ruff check .

# Check MCP installation
mcp version
```

### Current Project Structure
```
test-mcp/
├── .venv/              # Virtual environment
├── pyproject.toml      # Project configuration
├── uv.lock            # Dependency lock file
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

### Notes
- We encountered and resolved a virtual environment conflict due to the automatic activation in `.zshrc`
- The `uv sync` command successfully resolved and audited the packages
- All ruff checks passed, indicating proper code formatting

Next steps would typically involve creating your MCP server implementation and testing it, but we haven't gotten to that part yet. Would you like to proceed with that?
